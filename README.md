INTEX code

users.ejs
 - sort functionality? should be a quick add

events.ejs
 - sort? search?

donations.ejs
 - sort/search?

milestones.ejs
 - search, add, view (do we need?), sort
 - edit button only viewable by admins and the relevant user


many
 - change redirects to login page or when relevant the unauthorized error page
 - gotta add the teapot error


to test - adding a survey
CRUD on surveys? did I do that? I forgot
pass in more back buttons and variables about event names and stuff across pages.


-- calculate user donation total instead of referencing the static column
