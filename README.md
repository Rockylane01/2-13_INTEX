# 2-13_INTEX
INTEX code


To-Do on Jason branch:

users.ejs
 - edit user functionality
 - search functionality
 - add user functionality? I think we should remove that button
 - sort functionality? should be a quick add

admin.ejs
 - view surveys is broken -- I don't know if there's a working spot for that yet

events.ejs
 - sort? search?

donations.ejs
 - sort/search?

profile button in header
 - use session.userid to display profile.
 - allow user to see sensitive info on their own profile.
 - forgot if I let admins do that for all.

milestones.ejs
 - search, add, view (do we need?), sort
 - edit button only viewable by admins and the relevant user

index.ejs
 - all users can currently see the admin button (but not use it, which is good)

many
 - change redirects to login page or when relevant the unauthorized error page

 - gotta add the teapot error


to test - adding a survey
CRUD on surveys? did I do that? I forgot
pass in more back buttons and variables about event names and stuff across pages.
