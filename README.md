To-Do on Jason branch:

- check if all views are accessible
- for registration, add the table of signed up if hasn't ended, attended if has ended.
- admins can see all who registered, even if no-show or cancelled.
- admins can check people in. If no check in by end, they are no-show.
- if it has ended, admins can see survey button instead.

- create the survey and its routes.
