INTEX code

users.ejs
 - sort functionality? should be a quick add

events.ejs
 - sort? search?

donations.ejs
 - sort/search?

milestones.ejs
 - search, add, view (do we need?), sort
 - edit button only viewable by admins and the relevant user


many
 - change redirects to login page or when relevant the unauthorized error page
 - gotta add the teapot error


pass in more back buttons and variables about event names and stuff across pages.


-- calculate user donation total instead of referencing the static column


RECOMMENDATIONS if approved:
    - require admin approval to have a member (non-guest) account.
    - calculate the a few more columns instead of having them coded in, notably the total donations per user.
    - users can manage their own info and delete their account
    - more robust difference between event template and specific event details
    - actually make payment info work

    FIX BACK BUTTON ON SURVEY TO NOT JUST GO TO EVENT
