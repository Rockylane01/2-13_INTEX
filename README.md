# 2-13_INTEX
INTEX code


 - gotta add the teapot error

-- calculate user donation total instead of referencing the static column


RECOMMENDATIONS if approved:
    - require admin approval to have a member (non-guest) account.
    - calculate the a few more columns instead of having them coded in, notably the total donations per user.
    - users can manage their own info and delete their account
    - more robust difference between event template and specific event details
    - actually make payment info work

    FIX BACK BUTTON ON SURVEY TO NOT JUST GO TO EVENT
